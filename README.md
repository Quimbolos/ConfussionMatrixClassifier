# ConfussionMatrixClassifier

The code aims to elaborate a summary of prediction results on a classification problem by determining the number of TP, FP, FN and TN:

- TP (True Positives): Point is both expected and found
- FN (False Negatives): Point is expected but not found
- FP (False Positives): Point is not in expected but is found
- TN (True Negatives): Point is neither expected nor found (usually undefined)

The number of TP, FP, FN and TN is obtained by comparing the set of expected points and the set of found points.
